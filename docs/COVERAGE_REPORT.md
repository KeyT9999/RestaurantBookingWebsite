## 🎯 Best Practices

### Coverage Guidelines
1. **Focus on critical paths**: Business logic first
2. **Test edge cases**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios
3. **Avoid coverage gaming**: Don't write tests just for coverage
4. **Maintain quality**: Coverage is a tool, not a goal

### Test Writing Standards
1. **Meaningful assertions**: Test behavior, not implementation
2. **Clear test names**: Describe what is being tested
3. **Independent tests**: No dependencies between tests
4. **Realistic data**: Use production-like test data
