# WithdrawalService - Prompt Summary

## User Request

```
Tôi muốn Tạo JUnit Test cho phần này ảnh trên
Hãy cho tôi câu lệnh để test phần từ các phần ảnh 
Sau khi có câu lệnh lưu câu lệnh lại
Sau đó gửi câu lệnh + Test case
nếu chưa pass hết hãy sửa để có tí lệ pass ở mức >90% và có thể chấp nhận dưới 100%
Đồng thời chạy xong thì có thể học hỏi từ folder Z_Folder_for_MD để tham khảo
```

## Nội dung ảnh

**Sheet 1:** `requestWithdrawal()` (createWithdrawal) - 8+ Cases
1. Happy Path: With sufficient balance, should create request with PENDING status
2. Happy Path: Should calculate net amount (amount - commission = 500000)
3. Business Logic: Minimum amount (100k) should succeed
4. Validation: Insufficient balance should throw exception "Số dư không đủ"
5. Validation: Below minimum amount (<100k) should throw exception
6. Business Logic: Exceed daily limit (>=3) should throw exception "giới hạn"
7. Business Logic: Should send notification
8. Error Handling: Invalid bank account (not belong to restaurant) should throw exception
9. Error Handling: Non-existent restaurant should throw ResourceNotFoundException

**Sheet 2:** `processWithdrawal()` (approveWithdrawal) - 6+ Cases
11. Happy Path: With PENDING request, should approve successfully
12. Happy Path: Should lock restaurant balance (pending withdrawal updated)
13. Business Logic: Insufficient balance should throw exception
14. Business Logic: Should use pessimistic locking (FOR UPDATE)
16. Validation: Cannot approve non-PENDING status
18. Integration: Should update admin notes (reviewedBy, reviewedAt, adminNotes)

**Sheet 3:** `rejectWithdrawal()` - 4+ Cases
19. Happy Path: With PENDING request, should reject successfully
20. Business Logic: Should NOT unlock balance when rejected
21. Business Logic: Should send notification
22. Validation: Cannot reject non-PENDING
23. Error Handling: Non-existent request should throw ResourceNotFoundException
25. Integration: Should update rejection timestamps

**Sheet 4:** `getWithdrawalHistory()` (getWithdrawalsByRestaurant) - 3+ Cases
26. Happy Path: Valid restaurant, should return all requests
27. Happy Path: Returns paginated results
28. Business Logic: Filter by restaurant
30. Edge Case: No history, should return empty page

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Tìm hiểu WithdrawalService ✅
- Located `WithdrawalService.java` (570 lines)
- Identified 4 public methods to test:
  - `createWithdrawal()` - Creates withdrawal request
  - `approveWithdrawal()` - Approves withdrawal with pessimistic locking
  - `rejectWithdrawal()` - Rejects withdrawal
  - `getWithdrawalsByRestaurant()` - Gets paginated withdrawal history
- Analyzed dependencies:
  - WithdrawalRequestRepository
  - RestaurantBankAccountRepository
  - RestaurantProfileRepository
  - RestaurantBalanceRepository
  - RestaurantBalanceService
  - WithdrawalNotificationService

### Step 2: Tạo Test Suite ✅
- Created `WithdrawalServiceTest.java` (515 lines)
- Total: **25 test cases** (9 + 6 + 6 + 4)
- Organized into 4 nested test classes:
  - `RequestWithdrawalTests` (9 tests)
  - `ProcessWithdrawalTests` (6 tests)
  - `RejectWithdrawalTests` (6 tests)
  - `GetWithdrawalHistoryTests` (4 tests)
- Used Mockito for all dependencies
- Setup comprehensive test data in @BeforeEach

### Step 3: Tạo Scripts & Documentation ✅
- Created `run_withdrawal_service_tests.bat`
- Created `13_run_withdrawal_service_tests.md`
- Created `13_WithdrawalService_COVERAGE.md`
- Created `13_WithdrawalService_PROMPT_SUMMARY.md`

### Step 4: Run Tests & Fix Issues ✅

#### Iteration 1 (Initial Run)
- Tests run: 25
- Failures: 4
- Errors: 2
- Pass rate: **76%**

**Issues Found:**
1. Test 4: NullPointerException - `withdrawalRepository.save()` returned null
2. Test 5: UnnecessaryStubbingException - Extra mocks not used
3. Test 6: UnnecessaryStubbingException - Extra mocks not used
4. Test 8: NullPointerException - Missing `balanceService.getOrCreateBalance()` mock
5. Test 9: NullPointerException - Missing balance mock
6. Test 13: Expected exception not thrown - Balance validation issue

#### Iteration 2 (After Fixes)
- Tests run: 25
- Failures: 0
- Errors: 0
- Pass rate: **100%** ✅

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **Test 4 (Insufficient Balance)**: 
   - Removed unnecessary mocks
   - Set balance state properly (totalRevenue, availableBalance, pendingWithdrawal)
2. **Test 5 (Below Minimum)**:
   - Removed all mocks (validation happens before balance check)
3. **Test 6 (Exceed Daily Limit)**:
   - Removed extra mocks (only need countByRestaurantIdAndDateRange)
4. **Test 8 (Invalid Bank Account)**:
   - Added `balanceService.getOrCreateBalance()` mock
   - Created separate invalidBankAccount object
5. **Test 9 (Non-Existent Restaurant)**:
   - Added balance and count mocks
   - Restaurant check happens AFTER validation
6. **Test 13 (Insufficient Balance on Approval)**:
   - Set totalRevenue and balance state properly
   - Added pendingWithdrawal initialization

## Test Results

### Final Run (Iteration 2)
- Tests run: 25
- Failures: 0
- Errors: 0
- Pass rate: **100%** ✅
- Execution time: ~1.5 seconds

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `src/test/java/com/example/booking/service/WithdrawalServiceTest.java` (25 tests, 515 lines)

## Key Features Tested

### Business Rules
1. **Withdrawal Constraints**
   - Minimum amount: 100,000 VND
   - Maximum daily withdrawals: 3 per restaurant
   - Available balance >= withdrawal amount
   - Bank account must belong to restaurant

2. **Transaction Safety**
   - Pessimistic locking (FOR UPDATE) on withdrawal request
   - Pessimistic locking (FOR UPDATE) on restaurant balance
   - Balance recalculation before approval
   - Atomic balance updates

3. **Status Transitions**
   - PENDING → APPROVED (with balance locking)
   - PENDING → REJECTED (no balance change)
   - Non-PENDING cannot be approved or rejected

4. **Notifications**
   - Withdrawal created notification
   - Withdrawal approved notification
   - Withdrawal rejected notification

5. **Audit Trail**
   - Admin metadata (reviewedByUserId, reviewedAt)
   - Admin notes on approval
   - Rejection reason on rejection
   - Created/updated timestamps

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Mock Strategy**: Only mock what's actually called in the execution path
   - Early validation doesn't need repository mocks
   - Balance checks need both service and balance mocks

2. **Test Data Setup**: Properly initialize all balance fields
   - availableBalance
   - totalRevenue
   - pendingWithdrawal
   - All affect balance calculations

3. **Execution Order**: Understand service method flow
   - Validation → Repository lookups → Balance checks → Save
   - Mock in the correct order

4. **Pessimistic Locking**: Special repository methods for concurrency
   - `findByIdForUpdate()` for withdrawal request
   - `findByRestaurantIdForUpdate()` for balance

5. **Nested Test Classes**: Improve organization and readability
   - Group related tests together
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Better test names with context
