## Key Test Patterns

### 1. Mocking Strategy
- All repository dependencies mocked using Mockito
- `@Mock` annotations for clean test setup
- `@InjectMocks` for service instantiation
- Behavior verification using `verify()`

### 2. Test Structure
- **Nested test classes** for logical grouping
- **Given-When-Then** pattern for clarity
- **DisplayName** annotations in Vietnamese for client understanding
- **assertDoesNotThrow** for positive cases
- **assertThrows** for negative cases with specific exception types

### 3. Time Handling
- Uses `LocalDateTime.now()` with relative offsets
- Avoids hardcoded dates to prevent time-based failures
- Tests boundary conditions (exact times, buffer times)

### 4. Exception Testing
- Verifies correct exception types (`IllegalArgumentException` vs `BookingConflictException`)
- Checks exception messages contain expected keywords
- Tests conflict type determination

## Business Rules Validated

### Booking Time Rules
1. ✅ Must be in the future (not past)
2. ✅ Must be at least 30 minutes in advance
3. ✅ Must be within 30 days in advance
4. ✅ Must be within restaurant operating hours

### Table Status Rules
1. ✅ AVAILABLE tables can be booked
2. ✅ OCCUPIED tables cannot be booked
3. ✅ MAINTENANCE tables cannot be booked
4. ✅ RESERVED tables checked via booking schedule

### Conflict Detection Rules
1. ✅ 30-minute buffer before and after bookings
2. ✅ 2-hour default booking duration
3. ✅ Overlap detection for time conflicts
4. ✅ Exclusion of current booking when updating

### Operating Hours Rules
1. ✅ Default hours: 10:00-22:00
2. ✅ Custom hours parsing: "HH:MM-HH:MM"
3. ✅ Fallback to default on parsing errors
4. ✅ Rejection of bookings outside hours
